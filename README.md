What is this app about?
This application is a Desktop App utilizing the .NET Framework in C# in order to help users more easily find songs to download

This app is for users that have modded their legal versions of the game in order to play user generated songs more easily.

This app exists because a mod that was created for ingame song search was not versatile enough for my standards. After looking around for about a week, I couldn't find any websites that had a versatile enough way of searching up songs, it always felt that some were skipping on something.

As a result I found the API for how these websites are running and implemented that into this code and got a working version very quickly in about 3 days. Since then its been mainly looking to clean up the visuals and user experience.

Though this app does not give the user all the possible functions the API has to offer, it will still be updated to eventually add that functionality.

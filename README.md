What is this app about?
This application is a Desktop App utilizing the .NET Framework in C# in order to help users more easily find songs to download for the VR game Beat Saber.

This app is for users that have modded their legal versions of the game in order to play user generated songs more easily.

This app exists because a mod that was created for ingame song search was not versatile enough for my standards. After looking around for about a week, I couldn't find any websites that had a versatile enough way of searching up songs. It always felt like all of them were skipping on something in some way.

As a result I found the API for how these websites are running and implemented that into this code. After finding the API, it took about 3 days to make a completely working version in which the majority of the backend is what is currently present. Since then, it's been mainly looking to clean up the visuals and user experience.

Though this app does not give the user all the possible functions the API has to offer, it will still be updated to eventually add that functionality.
